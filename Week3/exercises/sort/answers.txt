sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Cause it took almost twice the time of Selection Sort to sort 50000 lines, as per it complexity when n = 50000  (n^2 - 2n + 1)

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Cause it was very faster for a long list, as per it complexity (n log n)

sort3 uses: Selection Sort
