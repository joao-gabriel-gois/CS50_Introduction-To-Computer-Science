1) Songs better ranked tend to have less energy, danceability and valence than the average of the whole 100 songs. Which means that, from all most listen, the slower/calmer songs - of this very same top list compared to itself - are better ranked.
2) This aura are not considering genre-related tastes. A person can tend to hear more danceable music, but its Salsa instead of Hip Hop, for example. So it would be good to keep track of the genre and most-common artists and then relate the daily / seasonal mood of this user with the energy, danceability and valence, already mapping better its given taste context.
