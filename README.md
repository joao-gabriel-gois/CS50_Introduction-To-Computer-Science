# CS 50 - Notes


### Check bellow info in order to study locally:
 * ### _To run C source code locally_:
    - <strong>It is <u>mandatory</u> to install cs50 library (lcs50)</strong>: 
      
      - [CS 50: lib for C <cs50.h> - Installation Doc](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/)
      
      <br>
    - <strong> To compile on <u>Linux / Unix</u> based OS using GCC:</strong>

      1. Instead of __make, <u>in case of any errors</u>,__ add script called `run` in a file in your user directory (`~`).

      </br>

      2. Now allow it to execute:

          *
            ```
            chmod u+x ~/run
            ```

      3. **Done!** Now you can run directly from source code, in any directory, without remaining binaries, by running like examples below:
      
          * Using relative path (from current directory): 
          
            ```
            ~/run ../relative/path/to/file_name.c
            ```

          * Or any source code in the current directory:

            ```
            ~/run file_name.c
            ```


### Class 0:
  - #### *Introduction*:
    - Basic programming logic.
    - [Check Scratch project here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/658005563/)


### Class 1:
  - #### _Summary and Lecture_:
    - __C language__: data types, loops, branches (if/else), functions (returning values, declaration X assignment), variables, consts, I/O;

    - __Lecture__: [CS-50: Class 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/weeks/1/);

    - __File `calculator.c` implements all points mentioned in this class, also `mario.c` is an important example for loop__
